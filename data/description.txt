/TSLA_2010_2018 is a copy of https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?period1=1277769600&period2=1535414400&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true (March 31th 2022).

As a first preprocessing step, I looked through which of the files in /tweets are actually needed since most files 
contain multiple years, those needed along with the datasets for Tesla stock prices are in /needed.

TSLA_2010_2019 does not have the same data for the same day as TSLA_2017_2022. The values seem to be multiplied by 5 for the prices, don't know by what factor for the volume.
Found new data set TSLA_2010_2018 which has the same values and very close volume to TSLA_2017_2022. Will use that one to make one big dataset.
